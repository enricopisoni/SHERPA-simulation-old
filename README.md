# SHERPA-simulation

## Testing the current used modules
The current used modules are:

-  Module 1 (scenario assessment): to simulate the impact on air quality of a specific emission reduction scenario (defined also through the previous two steps)
-  Module 3 (Source allocation): to understand how the air quality in a given area is influenced by different sources. This module runs in two modes: precursor-based source allocation, and sector-based one. Note that this module works running module 4 and module 1, in sequence.
-  Module 4: (Potency): this module computes potencies, and it is not directly launched by the user. On the contrary, it is used by Module 3.
-  Module 6 (Governance): to analyze how one should coordinate with the surrounding regions to optimally improve air quality;
-  Module 8 (health impact): to evaluate PM2.5 health-related impact, when running module 1
-  Module 9 (aggregation): to aggregate emissions and concentrations, at NUTS or FUAs level.
-  Module 10 (cost module): to compute costs of end-of-pipe technologies required to reach a given emission reduction target.

All modules have been tested with the 0.1x0.1 (also with downscaling) version; for the 0.1x0.05 version all modules works, except module 8 (health impact evalution needs additional files, to be created) and module 9 (this needs also interaction with GUI to be tested).

## Working with SRR at both 0.1x0.1 and 0.1x0.05 deg resolution
Now the code has been adapted creating a new 'sherpa_globals.py', to allow simulations for

- SRR at 0.1x0.1 degrees (using 'sherpa_globals_cams42_01_01.py')
- SRR at 0.1x0.05 degrees (using 'sherpa_globals_cams42_01_005.py')

To use one of the 2 options, please copy 'sherpa_globals_cams42_01_**.py' to 'sherpa_globals.py'

Note that the downscaling feature (presented in the next subsection) works both for 0.1x0.1 and 0.1x0.05 SRR.

## Preparing results for the downscaling module
In this branch I adapt the 0.1x0.1 deg resolutionSRR to work with a new downscaling module. This module requires a different structure of emissions and concentration files.

For emissions:

- a unique file for all air quality indexes, containing all precursors and (for PM) PPM2.5, PPMco, PPM10
- same content should be available for basecase (initial) emissions and delta (resulting from the SRR simulation) emissions 
- the code will work with 12 GNFR sectors
- note that PPM10 = PPM2.5 + PMco

For concentrations

- you also need basecase files for PPM2.5 and PPM10 concentrations
- the PPM2.5 basecase is directly extracted from the EMEP results, the PPM10 is on the contrary computed as the sum of PPM2.5 + PPMco
- not that the SRR for PM downscaling will be run twice: once to simulate total PM2.5 (or PM10) and once to simulate the PPM2.5 (or PPM10) reductions. This second run is performed only reducing PPM2.5 or PPM10 emissions.

Now the code uses different tagas for emissions definitions (PPM25 or PPM10, depending on emissions to be reduced). 
Also now a new variable has been added when running module1 (downscale_request). 
If the variable downscale_request=0, a run with normal reductions is done. If downscale_request=1 then a run is done only reducing PPM emissions. 
This second run creates concentrations change for the PPM component. Finally, now filename are automatically created, depending on the concentrations to be modelled.
But also depending on the downscale_request. When downscale_request=1 indeed a 'primary' tag is added to the module1 output file.

# Module available for simulation
With this code you can run simulations with the SHERPA SRR (built i.e. with the git repository SHERPA-training), to evaluate the impact of emission reduction scenarios on concentrations.
This version of the SHERPA-simulation code has been tested withe the EDGAR2015 emission inventory, and with SRR built from EMEP air quality model simulations.

The modules that can be used in the code are:

-  Module 1 (scenario assessment): to simulate the impact on air quality of a specific emission reduction scenario (defined also through the previous two steps)
-  Module 3 (Source allocation): to understand how the air quality in a given area is influenced by different sources. This module runs in two modes: precursor-based source allocation, and sector-based one. Note that this module works running module 4 and module 1, in sequence.
-  Module 6 (Governance): to analyze how one should coordinate with the surrounding regions to optimally improve air quality;
-  Module 8 (health impact): to evaluate PM2.5 health-related impact, when running module 1
-  Module 9 (aggregation): to aggregate emissions and concentrations, at NUTS or FUAs level.
